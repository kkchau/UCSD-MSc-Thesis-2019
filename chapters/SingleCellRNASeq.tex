\chapter{Single-Cell RNA-Seq of Mouse Models}

Single-cell RNA-Seq analysis was performed as part of pilot study in heterogeneous 16p11.$2^{+/-}$ and Cul$3^{+/-}$ deletion mouse models. For both experiments, scRNA-Seq data was extracted and quantified using the \textit{Cell Ranger} software package by 10X Genomics. Downstream analysis was performed using the \textit{Seurat} R package [SATIJA LAB REFERENCE HERE].
