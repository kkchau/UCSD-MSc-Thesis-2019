abstract = {We have developed an automated method for discovering tissue-specific regulation of alternative splicing through a genome-wide analysis of expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Using this approach, we have identified 667 tissue-specific alternative splice forms of human genes. We validated our muscle-specific and brain-specific splice forms for known genes. A high fraction (8/10) were reported to have a matching tissue specificity by independent studies in the published literature. The number of tissue-specific alternative splice forms is highest in brain, while eye-retina, muscle, skin, testis and lymph have the greatest enrichment of tissue-specific splicing. Overall, 10-30{\%} of human alternatively spliced genes in our data show evidence of tissue-specific splice forms. Seventy-eight percent of our tissue-specific alternative splices appear to be novel discoveries. We present bioinformatics analysis of several tissue-specific splice forms, including automated protein isoform sequence and domain prediction, showing how our data can provide valuable insights into gene function in different tissues. For example, we have discovered a novel kidney-specific alternative splice form of the WNK1 gene, which appears to specifically disrupt its N-terminal kinase domain and may play a role in PHAII hypertension. Our database greatly expands knowledge of tissue-specific alternative splicing and provides a comprehensive dataset for investigating its functional roles and regulation in different human tissues.},

abstract = {Through alternative processing of pre-messenger RNAs, individual mammalian genes often produce multiple mRNA and protein isoforms that may have related, distinct or even opposing functions. Here we report an in-depth analysis of 15 diverse human tissue and cell line transcriptomes on the basis of deep sequencing of complementary DNA fragments, yielding a digital inventory of gene and mRNA isoform expression. Analyses in which sequence reads are mapped to exon-exon junctions indicated that 92-94{\%} of human genes undergo alternative splicing, 86{\%} with a minor isoform frequency of 15{\%} or more. Differences in isoform-specific read densities indicated that most alternative splicing and alternative cleavage and polyadenylation events vary between tissues, whereas variation between individuals was approximately twofold to threefold less common. Extreme or 'switch-like' regulation of splicing between tissues was associated with increased sequence conservation in regulatory regions and with generation of full-length open reading frames. Patterns of alternative splicing and alternative cleavage and polyadenylation were strongly correlated across tissues, suggesting coordinated regulation of these processes, and sequence conservation of a subset of known regulatory motifs in both alternative introns and 3' untranslated regions suggested common involvement of specific factors in tissue-level regulation of both splicing and polyadenylation.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Gene expression data have become an instrumental resource in describing the molecular state associated with various cellular phenotypes and responses to environmental perturbations. The utility of expression profiling has been demonstrated in partitioning clinical states, predicting the class of unknown samples and in assigning putative functional roles to previously uncharacterized genes based on profile similarity. However, gene expression profiling has had only limited success in identifying therapeutic targets. This is partly due to the fact that current methods based on fold-change focus only on single genes in isolation, and thus cannot convey causal information. In this paper, we present a technique for analysis of expression data in a graph-theoretic framework that relies on associations between genes. We describe the global organization of these networks and biological correlates of their structure. We go on to present a novel technique for the molecular characterization of disparate cellular states that adds a new dimension to the fold-based methods and conclude with an example application to a human medulloblastoma dataset. RESULTS: We have shown that expression networks generated from large model-organism expression datasets are scale-free and that the average clustering coefficient of these networks is several orders of magnitude higher than would be expected for similarly sized scale-free networks, suggesting an inherent hierarchical modularity similar to that previously identified in other biological networks. Furthermore, we have shown that these properties are robust with respect to the parameters of network construction. We have demonstrated an enrichment of genes having lethal knockout phenotypes in the high-degree (i.e. hub) nodes in networks generated from aggregate condition datasets; using process-focused Saccharomyces cerivisiae datasets we have demonstrated additional high-degree enrichments of condition-specific genes encoding proteins known to be involved in or important for the processes interrogated by the microarrays. These results demonstrate the utility of network analysis applied to expression data in identifying genes that are regulated in a state-specific manner. We concluded by showing that a sample application to a human clinical dataset prominently identified a known therapeutic target. AVAILABILITY: Software implementing the methods for network generation presented in this paper is available for academic use by request from the authors in the form of compiled linux binary executables.},

@article{Yeo2004,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alternative pre-mRNA splicing (AS) is widely used by higher eukaryotes to generate different protein isoforms in specific cell or tissue types. To compare AS events across human tissues, we analyzed the splicing patterns of genomically aligned expressed sequence tags (ESTs) derived from libraries of cDNAs from different tissues. RESULTS: Controlling for differences in EST coverage among tissues, we found that the brain and testis had the highest levels of exon skipping. The most pronounced differences between tissues were seen for the frequencies of alternative 3' splice site and alternative 5' splice site usage, which were about 50 to 100{\%} higher in the liver than in any other human tissue studied. Quantifying differences in splice junction usage, the brain, pancreas, liver and the peripheral nervous system had the most distinctive patterns of AS. Analysis of available microarray expression data showed that the liver had the most divergent pattern of expression of serine-arginine protein and heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein genes compared to the other human tissues studied, possibly contributing to the unusually high frequency of alternative splice site usage seen in liver. Sequence motifs enriched in alternative exons in genes expressed in the brain, testis and liver suggest specific splicing factors that may be important in AS regulation in these tissues. CONCLUSIONS: This study distinguishes the human brain, testis and liver as having unusually high levels of AS, highlights differences in the types of AS occurring commonly in different tissues, and identifies candidate cis-regulatory elements and trans-acting factors likely to have important roles in tissue-specific AS in human cells.},

abstract = {To elucidate gene function on a global scale, we identified pairs of genes that are coexpressed over 3182 DNA microarrays from humans, flies, worms, and yeast. We found 22,163 such coexpression relationships, each of which has been conserved across evolution. This conservation implies that the coexpression of these gene pairs confers a selective advantage and therefore that these genes are functionally related. Many of these relationships provide strong evidence for the involvement of new genes in core biological functions such as the cell cycle, secretion, and protein expression. We experimentally confirmed the predictions implied by some of these links and identified cell proliferation functions for several genes. By assembling these links into a gene-coexpression network, we found several components that were animal-specific as well as interrelationships between newly evolved and ancient modules.},

abstract = {The brain has long been known to display the most complex pattern of alternative splicing, thereby producing diverse protein isoforms compared to other tissues. Recent evidence indicates that many alternative exons are neuron-specific, evolutionarily conserved, and found in regulators of transcription including DNA-binding protein and histone modifying enzymes. This raises a possibility that neurons adopt unique mechanisms of transcription. Given that transcriptional machineries are frequently mutated in neurodevelopmental disorders with cognitive dysfunction, it is important to understand how neuron-specific alternative splicing contributes to proper transcriptional regulation in the brain. In this review, we summarize current knowledge regarding how neuron-specific splicing events alter the function of transcriptional regulators and shape unique gene expression patterns in the brain and the implications of neuronal splicing to the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders.},
